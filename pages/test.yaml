    This is alt text for the image - some stock photo I found on google of a misty mountain lake scene.

  This is an example of some content, I'm not _entirely_ sure how I will insert things like images or links into this
  text, but I imagine I might be able to get away by nesting some things in here potentially. I want you to roughly be
  able to use markdown in here for _italics_, **bold**, and [links](https://google.com/), but we'll see about that.
