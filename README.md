# Spindrift

A really really simple static site generator focused on short posts (droplets) that feature an optional image and
text-based content. Each post/droplet is a simple yaml file that takes some metadata, an optional image, and text content that will (eventually) support basic markdown.

The `pages` dir is an example dir with a single .yaml and jpeg.

### Goals

- Markdown support in text content
- S3 or other storage backends for images
- Basic themeing framework for custom css
